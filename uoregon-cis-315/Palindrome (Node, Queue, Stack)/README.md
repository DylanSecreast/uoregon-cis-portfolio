# Palindrome (Node, Queue, Stack)
The Palindrome class is a driver class to test functionality of Queue and Stack data structures.

Prompts user for string to test if palindrome or not by iterating through character-by-character, comparing with queue's FIFO and stack's LIFO. If each character matches in both data structures for whole string, then string is a palindrome. Reports with results.

All atomic operations are implemented in O(1).
